He didn’t get much sleep when he went back to bed. Few coughing episodes here and there, but nothing major, assisted him to recover by adjusting him to sit up straight and tilt forward to avoid choking, 30-40 seconds of this and getting him to breath in and out and staying calm, always does the trick. After his recovery a nice drinking water clears the throat airways and it’s easier to swallow and cough. **Assessments and Activities: •Behaviour •Personal Care •Medications •Skin Checks (if necessary) •Food Intake •Activities** NA **Incidents and Action** NA **Plans and Handover for Next Shift** NA **Irregular Shift Notes (If Any - in this format) - Start Time/ End Time / Activity** NA"

Carmel called out for me to let myself in. I obliged. Carmel was just coming out of her bedroom when I entered her unit. Exchange pleasantries. Carmel took me to her bathroom and pointed to the duress on the wall. She stated that she tried to use it last night as she needed PRN but she didn’t hear anything back from concierge. I pressed the button a few times and told her that I will check once I get back to the office. I asked her about the small duress button which I found sitting on her dining table. I advised her to keep on her and use that duress key. She was happy to have the duress that she can keep on her rather than walking to the bathroom. I put my gloves on. Carmel showed me to her bedroom and showed me where the safe is. I punched in the code then got her medication out. I put 6pm medication in the container. Carmel asked for PRN. I checked for PRN medication but not much info ie doses. I assisted with Webster pack and PRN. Carmel asked for me to put 8pm and 6am in a container for her.

Ross Daly,27-12-2025,Notes,Hayley Mons Mackellar added a Note for Ross Daly @ 26/12/2025 10:00 pm - 06:00 am,"**General Status:** Upon arrival at 10:00 PM, Ross was asleep in his bedroom. He awoke at approximately 12:00 AM. A pad change was completed (LT7 – bowels opened). Bluey/blanket was removed due to soiling, and the blanket was placed in the wash. A clean blanket was provided; however, no spare Blueys were available, so a new one could not be applied. Ross and I had a good conversation; he spoke about his love of animals, particularly dogs. The television was turned on for him, and he was repositioned comfortably in bed. Food and fluids were offered; however, Ross declined and stated he was okay. While Ross was watching television, I noticed a significant number of ants and cockroaches in the kitchen/lounge area. Upon checking the kitchen, mouldy bananas were found in the fruit bowl. These were disposed of, and the kitchen was cleaned. Staff are reminded to regularly check food items and expiry dates, as spoiled food poses a health and safety risk and contributes to pest infestation. Ross later returned to sleep, waking at 3:00 AM and continued watching tv until 5:30 AM, food and fluids were again offered during this time but he declined. Pad check at 3:30am confirmed he remained clean. Blanket was put in the drier, with previous dryer items folded into the basket.
